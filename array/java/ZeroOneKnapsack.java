/**
 * Problem statement: 
 * given two integer arrays val[0..n-1] and wt[0..n-1],
 * which represent values and weights associated with n items respectively.
 * Also given an integer W which represents knapsack capacity,
 * find out the maximum value subset of val[]
 * such that sum of the weights of this subset is smaller than or equal to W.
 * You cannot break an item, either pick the complete item, or donâ€™t pick it (0-1 property).
 * Solution: 0-1 knapsack problem.
 * using dyanamical programming.
 * resuisive formual:
 * let M[i][j] be the max value for choosing the 1..i items to fit into j weight knapsack.
 * then M[i][j] = 0 if i = 0 or j = 0
 *              = M[i-1][j] if weight[i] > j, the i-th item can not be put into j weight knapsack.
 *              = max(M[i-1][j], M[i-1][j-weight[i]]+val[i]) if weight[i] <= j,
 * in the last case, M[i][j] is max of:
 * 1) not including the i-th item
 * 2) including the i-th item
